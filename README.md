## Summary:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a customized dashboard on a local host using bootstrap and javascript. 
We created 3 charts: 
* Bar Chart - Displaying top 10 Bacterial Species (OTUs) 
* Bubble Chart - Displaying Cultures per Sample
* Gauge Chart - Weekly Washing Frequency

The three charts are used to visualize belly button bacterial data obtained from volunteers. The dashboard is interactive; the users are able to select the Test Subject's ID number from a drop down menu on the left. All three charts will update to display the data of the selected ID.

The dashboard was published via GitHub pages for accessibility: https://monsecc01.github.io/Plotly_Deployment/
